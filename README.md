If you have access to some server or vm with only the bare minimum
and you're looking to quickly have a dev environment without too much
hassle then this might be for you.

A full description of setting up the environment and what kind of packages are installed can be found in the following [blog post](https://kirk86.github.io/2016/10/quickly-setup-dev-environment/)

For details see the README.md files inside the folders for each os.
